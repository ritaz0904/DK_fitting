DK_fitting

Computes the diffusion tensor and kurtosis tensor values for a data set. Results are saved into the file name specified. Final results include lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, vec1, vec2, vec3, K1, K2, K3, MK, exitLog, resLog, R2Log.
Follows the algorithm in the paper Tabesh A, Jensen JH, Ardekani BA, and Helpern JA. Estimation of tensors and tensor-derived measures in diffusional kurtosis imaging. Mag Reson Med. 2011 Mar;65(3):823-36.
